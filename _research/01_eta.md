When do traffic jams emerge? What are the factors affecting traffic patterns? Modelling realistic road traffic requires detailed understanding of the properties of the traffic flow. In traffic-flow modelling approaches, road traffic is modelled as far-from-equillibrium driven-systems.

I play around with microscopic traffic flow simulations to gain insight into factors affecting the traffic flow.

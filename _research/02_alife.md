How does brain process the sensory information? How is the sensory
information encoded in the brain? The only way to be certain of how
information is stored and retrieved by the brain is to build a mechanical
model of the brain. Since that is rather daunting task, field of Artificial
Life (AL) emerged. Soft-AL doesn't only concern itself with biological lifeform
but uses computer simulations to understand general properties of automata
that seem to exhibit life-like properties, e.g.,
[Braitenberg vehicles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braitenberg_vehicle)
which are reactive agents embedded in a simulated
two dimensional environment and reacts to sensory stimuli to produce motor
output.

I am interested in figuring out how to bring about a consistent
integration of top-down contextuality (agent-environment interaction) and
bottom-up organizing principles (how an agent dynamically organizes itself
in order to meet the challenges introduced by a dynamic environment)
for such autonomous agents.
                
I am also interested in evolutionary studies on population of such autonomous agents.
